Stellar classification is a fundamental task in understanding the universe. With the advent of large-scale surveys, automated classification using machine learning is quite helpful. 
In this project, I have presented an approach to stellar classification of galaxies, stars and quasars using spectral analysis, with the latest data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 17 (SDSS DR17) : https://www.sdss.org/dr17/

This Project has been a part of my sem-project for Engg Calculations.
